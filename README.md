## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was the first time I learn how to use useContext and useReducer. They works like magic! With useContext, we don't need to passing any props, which make everything easier to work with!

### Continued development

I wanna use useContext and useReducer more. I should master another React Hooks too, they're all awesome and help a lot.

### Useful resources

- [useContext Tutorial](https://upmostly.com/tutorials/how-to-use-the-usecontext-hook-in-react) - This helped me to understand the usage of useContext
- [useContext & useReducer](https://dev.to/jackent2b/the-best-couple-usecontext-usereducer-4e65) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand these React Hooks. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
